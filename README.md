# ♟ Chess Review

Free, open-source game review for your online chess games, powered by Stockfish NNUE running
locally in your browser. One click turns any **Chess.com** or **Lichess** game into a full
review — accuracy scores, move-by-move classifications, an evaluation graph, and an estimated
rating. No account, no server, no manual PGN copying.

## Features

- **One-click review** of any Chess.com or Lichess game — or paste a game URL / raw PGN.
- **Accuracy scores** for both players, calibrated to be close to Chess.com's (≈95% correlated, within ~3 points on average).
- **Move classifications** from Brilliant to Blunder, with an evaluation graph and best-move arrows.
- **Estimated rating** — a rough guide to the level each player performed at in the game.
- **Opening detection** from an offline book, named even for PGNs without headers.
- **Explore variations** directly on the board, with live engine evaluation.
- **Play Coach mode** — Play interactive training games against an adaptive local engine coach (Beginner to Expert) with progressive hints, threat detection, takebacks, and commentary.
- **Runs entirely on your machine** — your games never leave your computer.

## Usage

1. Open a game on **Chess.com** or **Lichess**.
2. Click the extension icon → **Analyze this game**, or press `Ctrl+Shift+Y`.
3. The game opens in an analysis tab where Stockfish reviews every position.

For older games you don't have open, paste a game URL or PGN into the popup. Your username is
detected automatically from the board; if it can't be found, enter it once in the popup and it's
remembered.
